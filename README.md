**Hangman: Tech Company Challenge**
This Hangman game is a fun twist on the classic word-guessing game, where you’ll be guessing the names of popular tech companies. Test your knowledge of famous tech brands while enjoying the excitement of Hangman!

In this game, a random tech company name will be chosen, and your goal is to guess it one letter at a time. You’ll have a total of six tries to get the correct letters. Each time you make an incorrect guess, you lose a try. The game continues until you either guess the entire name correctly or run out of attempts.

To start, run the script in your terminal. The game will prompt you to guess letters, displaying correct letters in their places and showing which letters you’ve already guessed. Each wrong guess will cost you a try, and once your tries reach zero, the game is over. If you manage to guess the name within the given tries, you win!
